# SoftDes 2016 Setup Script

This repository contains a script to install [Python](https://www.python.org) (programming langue), [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) (Python notebooks), git (source control), and [Atom](https://atom.io) (text editor) on an Ubuntu [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) workstation.

## Usage

Type or paste the next line into a Terminal, and then press Enter.
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sd16spring/setup/master/ubuntu.sh | bash
```

This takes a while to complete.

If the last line of terminal output is "Success!", you're set -- return to the [Get Set](https://sites.google.com/site/sd16spring/home/assignments-and-mini-projects/setup-your-environment) page for further instructions.

Otherwise, ask a NINJA for help.
